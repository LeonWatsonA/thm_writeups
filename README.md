# TryHackMe Write-Ups
Here you will find all of my write-ups for TryHackMe boxes that I have completed.
It's possible some write-ups may be locked as to not spoil boxes too early and give others considerable time before spoiling the fun of learning.

I hope you find these write-ups helpful, I seek to maintain a level of proffesionalism with these reports as if I was writing these for a presentation.
All write-ups I do will be accompanied by a video, feel free to spare your time to watch how I interpret these vulnerable boxes. Your viewership is appreciated.

**NOTE: Consider giving yourself one more chance at exploiting the box you look to review my write up on.**
